# AEMT

Ape Escape Manipulation Toolkit is a handy set of tools for interacting with the KKIIDDZZ.DAT archive that's used within the game.

## Features

Here are the main things you can do:

- List files and offset/length via `list` command
- Extract files via `extract` command
- Patch files with bigger/smaller ones via `patch` command
- Directly edit the HED file via the `hedit`

## Upcoming

I would really like to bring audio, images and text extraction/conversion capabilities to this tool.
As of now I'm working on Sony's ADPCM decoding in order to assist with possible individuation of specific audio files.

## Contributing

Any contribution, as usual, is welcome.
